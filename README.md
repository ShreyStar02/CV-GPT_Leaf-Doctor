Major economic losses in the global agricultural sector are caused by plant diseases. To stop the spread of disease and make effective management
methods possible, plant health monitoring and early pathogen detection are crucial. Because many plant diseases directly impair the quality of the fruits, grains, and other plant products, they pose a serious threat to the world's food security and lower agricultural production. Due to the agro-based nature of the Indian economy, farmers have a lot of difficulty identifying and controlling diseases in the fauna. Therefore, it is essential to identify diseases in fauna since it is practical and beneficial for researchers. Farmers must observe and use their own eyes to evaluate whether a leaf is diseased. This method is unstable, inconsistent, and prone to mistakes. Farmers find it challenging to determine what fertilizers should be used to cure these diseases and how much should be applied when the condition is diagnosed. Additionally, they are unable to properly prevent some diseases that only sometimes strike people and about which the majority of people are ignorant. We present a novel method to get over these obstacles, one that uses an image to diagnose the ailment and the size of the field to determine how much fertilizer is needed to treat it. In order to prevent these circumstances from occurring again, the model also offers a few preventive steps.
